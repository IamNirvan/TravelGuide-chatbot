# TravelGuide - Chatbot
This project is a simple implementation of a chatbot using a neural network model for intent classification.

## Technologies
This project utilizes the following Python technologies:
- Numpy
- NLTK
- JSON
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Python

## Usage
To use the chatbot, simply run the Main.py script. The chatbot will start a conversation and wait for user input. Based on the user's input, the chatbot will generate a response.

To download all the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal window. 

```powershell
.\dependencies.bat     
```

This will download and install the dependencies into your virtual environment

Then run the Main.py file to utilize a pre-trained model to start making predictions
